                        <p>By ordering the Services with payment obligation, the client agrees to a subscription service contract to the defined conditions with no expiration date and no minimum contract duration. Upon order submission, the client receives an e-mail confirmation including a summary of the Services ordered and the terms of the contract.</p>
                        <p>The subscription is offered as a <span class="special"> monthly subscription </span> and runs with a monthly billing cycle. The start of the billing cycle is defined by the day of the order, meaning that the following billing cycle will start on the same date following month. If the monthly subscription is scheduled for a date that does not occur in a month (such as the 31st), the client is charged on the last day of the month instead. </p> 
                        <p>With the order submission ZuriAnalytics grants to You a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, and limited license for the term of the contract to access the XXX (product name) and use XXX Data & Services strictly for the limited purposes, and under the terms and conditions, as are set forth in this Agreement.</p>

                        <p>Subject to the terms herein, ZuriAnalytics will provide the client with access to XXX (PRODUCT) over the Internet. All calls to the API must reference the credentials issued to the client by ZuriAnalytics. The client may not disclose the credentials to any other party. The client is solely responsible for ensuring the secrecy and security of the credentials and will be responsible for all activities that occur using such credentials. The client shall not use ZuriAnalytics’ Services in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume or constitutes excessive or abusive usage.</p>
                        <p>The extent of the usage of XXX (PRODUCT) is dependent on the chosen subscription plan. The client shall not exceed the usage limits associated with the account. Unused amounts of call usage will not be carried over from one monthly period to the next. If the client exceeds the monthly usage limit, ZuriAnalytics has the right to pause the client’s access to the Services until the end of the billing cycle. With the start of the next billing cycle, the access to the Services will be renewed.</p>
                        <p>It is client’s sole responsibility to ensure that their application(s) properly detect and handle paused service availability. ZuriAnalytics will make reasonable efforts to help the client identify and resolve usage problems, or to review the suitability of their current subscription plan for their needs.</p>
                        <p>The client shall be solely responsible for acquiring, providing, and maintaining all software/hardware and Internet Services required to access the XXX (PRODUCT), including but not limited to telecommunication and internet connections, ISP, web browsers, and/or other equipment and software required to access and use the XXX (PRODUCT).</p>
                        <p>ZuriAnalytics is free to choose the technical means used to provide the agreed Services, unless agreed otherwise by contract. Examples of these technical means include infrastructure, platforms, transmission technologies and protocols as well as user interfaces.</p>
                        <p>ZuriAnalytics has the right to adjust the pricing as well as change the Services. ZuriAnalytics will communicate any change to the clients no shorter than 30 days before it comes in place, allowing the clients to change their subscription level or cancel it completely.</p>

                        <p>Bills are prepared on the basis of the agreed contract and monthly subscription.

Downgrade is only possible when changing from XXX and XXX to a lower service level. An upgrade is only possible when changing from XXX and XXX to a higher service level. The subscription adjustment needs to be requested via e-mail at <a class="special" href="mailto:contact@zurianalytics.com">contact@zurianalytics.com</a>.
